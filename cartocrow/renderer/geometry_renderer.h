/// An interface for rendering geometric objects to a GUI or a file.
/**
 * GeometryRenderer is a shared interface for all targets CartoCrow is able to
 * render to (currently a Qt panel, an Ipe file, or an SVG file). Subclasses of
 * this class are provided for each specific render target. The intended use is
 * to use the painting methods in this class from a GeometryPainting.
 *
 *
 * ## Styling
 *
 * GeometryRenderer has a set of methods to change the style it renders objects
 * with. It remembers the style set for any subsequent drawing operations.
 * Initially, the style is set to sensible default values (black stroke and
 * fill, stroke width 1, etc.) The methods \ref pushStyle() and \ref popStyle()
 * store the current style onto a stack, and restore the style last stored to
 * the stack, respectively. These methods can be used to draw with a different
 * style temporarily.
 *
 *
 * ## Native painter access
 *
 * In case advanced drawing operations are not possible with the interface
 * provided by GeometryRenderer, access is provided to the underlying native
 * painters. Of course, the caveat is that code written for a specific painter
 * will not work for other render targets: `nullptr` is returned when trying to
 * access the native painter of a different render target.
 *
 * The suggested idiom to draw with native painters for the various render
 * targets is:
 *
 * ```
 *     if (QPainter* painter = renderer.getQPainter()) {
 *         // do Qt-specific painting with QPainter
 *     } else if (Page* ipePage = renderer.getIpePage()) {
 *         // do Ipe-specific painting by adding objects to its Page
 *     }
 *     // etc.
 * ```
